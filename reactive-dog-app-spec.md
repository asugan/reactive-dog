## Conclusion

This app fills a genuine gap in the pet tech market. Reactive dog owners are:
- **Desperate for solutions** (high willingness to pay)
- **Under-served** (no dedicated apps)
- **Community-oriented** (word-of-mouth potential)
- **Data-motivated** (love tracking progress)

The combination of practical training tools + emotional support community creates a sticky product with clear monetization path.

**Status Update:** Supabase backend and dog profile onboarding are now complete and functional. The app automatically routes users through the onboarding flow (welcome → dog profile → assessment quiz → technique recommendation) before accessing the main app. Next priorities: trigger logging UI, progress charts, and BAT walk mode.
